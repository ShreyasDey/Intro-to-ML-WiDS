I have learned Python fundamentals and worked with key libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Under the guidance of my mentor, I implemented and practiced machine learning algorithms
including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks using scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

As a practical project, I built a neural network model for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset, achieving an accuracy of approximately 98% and also created various linear regression and logistic
regression models.
