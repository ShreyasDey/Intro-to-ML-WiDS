I have learned the basics of Python programming along with major libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I have practiced machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks with the aid of scikit-learn and TensorFlow under the direction of my mentor.

As the implementation project, I developed the neural network model for the classification of the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset with an accuracy of 98% precision.
